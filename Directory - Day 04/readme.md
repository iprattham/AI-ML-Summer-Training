## Overview
This project explores various concepts and techniques within K-means clustering, focusing on both manual and automatic clustering methods. The main goal is to understand how K-means works and enhance the clustering process through iterative refinement, including visualizations and re-clustering! ðŸ—¾

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **Manual Clustering**: Understanding the core of K-means clustering by manually assigning data points to clusters.
   
2. **Automatic Clustering**: Letting the K-means algorithm assign clusters automatically, based on the given data.

3. **2D Clustering**: Applying K-means to visualize clusters in a 2D space for better understanding of data distribution.

4. **Visualizing 4-cluster Data**: Created visualizations of data points clustered into four groups for easier interpretation and analysis.

5. **Iterative Clustering**: Improved the K-means algorithm by removing clusters, dividing them, and re-clustering the data for better accuracy and optimized results.

## Features
- **Manual vs. Automatic Clustering**: Compare and contrast between manually created clusters and algorithm-generated clusters.
  
- **2D Cluster Visualization**: View data points in a 2-dimensional space to understand the separation of clusters visually.

- **Iterative Improvements**: Refine clusters by iteratively removing, dividing, and re-clustering to see how accuracy improves.
  
## Usage
1. **Manual Clustering**: Understand how clustering works by manually assigning clusters.
2. **Automatic Clustering**: Apply the K-means algorithm to cluster your dataset.
3. **2D Visualization**: Visualize the clustered data points in a 2D space.
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Improve clustering by re-clustering after removing or dividing existing clusters.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of different K-means clustering techniques, focusing on visualizations, iterative improvement, and both manual and automatic approaches. It helps to enhance clustering algorithms for improved accuracy and performance. ðŸ”„
