Performed SVM concepts such as: Classification and Regression on diabetes.csv 🧬 & fish.csv 🐟, using various kernel parameters like 'linear', 'poly', and 'rbf'. Visualized the results through scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, etc., focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis to understand patterns, feature importance, and performance across different models! 🎛️🔍	

Here,
`ker = ['poly', 'linear', 'rbf']` represents a list of kernel types that are commonly used in Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification or regression tasks. Here's what each kernel means:

- poly: Polynomial kernel, which uses a polynomial function to map input data into a higher-dimensional space.
- linear: Linear kernel, which is the simplest kernel and works best when data is linearly separable.
- rbf: Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, a popular choice that can handle non-linear data by using a Gaussian function to measure similarity between data points.
